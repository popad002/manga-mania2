    <div class="body-copy">

      <p> Manga is a Japanese form of comics. They differ from their western counterparts
      both stylistically and by how they are read. Manga is read from right to
      left, which is the opposite direction of traditional western comic book
      reading. I initially became interested in this medium, due to my love of
      anime. Once I learned that the manga format of my favorite anime held much
      more information regarding the plot, I instantly became hooked. Over time,
      my collection has amounted to what it is today. I have exclusively grown my
      collection through garage sales and secondhand stores. This project contains
      a selection of some of my favorite volumes from the Naruto manga. I selected
      the volumes included in this collection based upon how interesting their cover
      art is and their significance in the overarching story.</p>

      <p>I am currently a senior graphic design student at the University of
      Wisconsin-Parkside. I enjoy creating interesting layouts in both print and
      digital mediums. In the future, I would like to create more web based designs.
